            "The Demystifying Artificial Intelligence project aims to make artificial intelligence more understandable and transparent by using Explainable AI (XAI) technologies such as LIME and SHAP. The project creates videos that explain the decision-making process of AI models in an easy-to-understand manner. By leveraging XAI, LIME, and SHAP, the project seeks to shed light on the inner workings of AI and help people understand why certain decisions are made. Ultimately, the project's goal is to make artificial intelligence more accessible and transparent to a wider audience through video learning.",
